## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of restaurants to extract valuable insights about customer preferences, pricing, location trends, and more. It aims to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to optimize business strategies.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical summaries of key attributes.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical data.
- **Insights Extraction:** Discovering trends in customer ratings, cuisine popularity, and pricing strategies.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karunkri/Restaurant-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Restaurant-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information about restaurants, including:
- **Restaurant Name**
- **Location**
- **Cuisine**
- **Average Cost for Two**
- **Ratings**
- **Number of Reviews**

## Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset and explored its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualized distributions of numerical and categorical features.
   - Analyzed relationships between ratings, cuisine, and cost.
3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
   - Scaled numerical data for consistency.
4. **Insights Generation:**
   - Identified popular cuisines and their average costs.
   - Examined how location influences restaurant ratings.

## Key Insights
- Restaurants offering "X Cuisine" tend to receive higher ratings in urban areas.
- Locations with more competition exhibit diverse pricing strategies.
- Certain cuisines are disproportionately reviewed compared to others, suggesting varying popularity.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** Preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset file is in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `COgnifyz_Task.ipynb` to replicate the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook COgnifyz_Task.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the documented steps to perform the analysis or add your own explorations.
